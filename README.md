The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed in the late 80s by Francesco Cirillo. The theory behind this technique is that taking frequent breaks can help improve your mental focus and prevent burnout. It can improve mental agility, boost motivation, and provide a better sense of accomplishment by breaking tasks into smaller chunks.
